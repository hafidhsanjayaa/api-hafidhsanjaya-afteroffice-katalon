# 📡 API Testing with Katalon Studio

This repository contains API automation test scripts built using **Katalon Studio**, as part of the Final Project in the After Office Academy Automation QA Bootcamp.

The tests are written to validate REST API endpoints using dummy API services provided by [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/).

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To demonstrate the ability to:
- Automate API test cases using Katalon Studio
- Assert response status, structure, and data
- Organize test cases into Test Suites and Test Collections

---

## 🧪 Test Scope

✅ **Request Types:**
- `GET` – Retrieve single & list of users  
- `POST` – Create a new user  
- `PUT` – Update user data  
- `DELETE` – Remove user  

✅ **Validations:**
- Status Code (e.g., 200, 201, 404)
- JSON Response Structure
- Field Assertions (e.g., name, id, createdAt)
- Negative Test Scenarios
- Use of Global Variables
- Organized in Test Suites & Collections
